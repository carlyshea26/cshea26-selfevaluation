As I finish this class, I can now say I’ve transformed from someone who dreaded coding into someone who genuinely enjoys it. Like Morphine Love Dion slaying the LaLaPaRuza Smackdown in Season 16, I’ve conquered my fear—especially when it comes to coding in R. Through countless modules, homework assignments, a group project, and a final replication assignment, I've gained experience with both statistical analysis in R and also formatting Rmd files-finding confidence in my coding capabilities along the way.

### What were you asked to do?


***

Please give me a bulleted/numbered list of each task you were asked to do for this course. Where relevant, please also link the *html* version of the file representing each task, in your own repos, to the bulleted entry for that task.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

1. Homework 1: Push It! (https://github.com/carlyshea26/AN588-Homework1-cshea26/blob/main/cshea26_FinalHomeworkCode_01.html)
2. Homework 2: Titis in the Mist... (https://github.com/carlyshea26/AN588-Titis-cshea26/blob/main/cshea26_FinalTitisCode_02.html)
3. Homework 3: Some of my Best Friends are Zombies... (https://github.com/carlyshea26/AN588_Zombies_cshea26/blob/main/cshea26_FinalHomeworkCode_03.html)
4. Homework 4: What's Your Malfunction (https://github.com/carlyshea26/AN588_Malfunction_cshea26/blob/main/cshea26_FinalHomeworkCode_04.html)
5. Homework 5: Boots for Days! (https://github.com/carlyshea26/AN588_Boots_cshea26/blob/main/cshea26_FinalHomeworkCode_05.html)
6. Replication Assignment (**INSERT WHEN COMPLETE**)
7. Group Vignette: Diversitree (https://github.com/auzeff/AN588_Vignette/blob/main/AN588_Vignette_References.html)

### What did you accomplish?

Through these homework/other assignments, I accomplished many of the tasks outlined in the course objectives (below are some important ones I wanted to highlight): 
- becoming familiar with concepts in applied data science
- testing hypotheses
- performing data analysis using version control (this was a challenge in the beginning of the course)
- interacting with both local and remote data sources
- implementing reproducible data science workflows
- accurately assessing, critiquing, and reproducing existing published works

From merely pushing my assignment in Homework 1 to later Bootstraping and writing functions using the Kamilar and Cooper data set in Homework 4 and 5, I can confidently attest that over the duration of the semester, my skills grew as the course expectations did as well. In terms of collaboration, I successfully was able to work as part of a team to problem solve and implement effective coding practices toward our final project. I also effectively communicated with group members for each homework assignment and delivered high quality peer commentary for each homework, highlighting objectives outlined in the courses' Intellectual Toolkit: Teamwork/Collaboration Section.

Please let me know how many of the above tasks you accomplished. If any of them were accomplished later than stipulated, please note that. If you contacted me about them being late (and we discussed it and I said it was ok), please note that, too. You may provide a bulleted/numbered list matching the one above.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

***

### How well did you accomplish them?

***

Please let me know how well you feel you accomplished your tasks, in a general sense. What do you feel you did the best, and what did you do the least well? What was the hardest part for you? Did your work/understanding/ease improve over the course of the semester?<br><br><br><br><br><br>

***

### How has your understanding of and approach to statistics and project design changed since taking this course?

***

This may be in relation to previous knowledge, or in relation to future/planned work.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

***

### What did you learn from all this?

***

Please name at least three things you feel you learned in this course.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

***

### What did your learn about teamwork in this course? How did the readings on teamwork foster this understanding? How did the teamwork experiences?

***

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

***

### How did the Peer Commentary process and Group Project relate, if at all, to what you view as your successes or difficulties in this course?

***

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

***

### What, if anything, of lasting value do you take away from this experience? If nothing, what would you do differently if you were to start over in this course? 

***

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

***

### Taking this self-assessment into account (and with **A** being the highest), if you were the instructor, what grade would you give yourself given your evaluation of your own performance this semester? Please be honest.
